"""StationeryBench scoring.

``task_success`` works both in the dependency-free mock (which reports privileged
success via the termination reason) and on real hardware: there is no success
oracle on a real bench, so the real embodiment turns the operator's
confirmation into either a ``"success"`` termination reason or a recorded
operator verdict — ``task_success`` accepts either.
